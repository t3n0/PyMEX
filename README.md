PyMEX: Python package for Moiré EXciton

## Description

We solved the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) for the exciton properties.
The software package is developed using mpi4py, numpy, scipy, cython and libraries.

This package helps you to compute moiré excitons with Wannier functions as basis.
You can also compute the excitons of 2D materials accurately at a fraction of the conventional GW-BSE approach.
